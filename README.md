# DeepSeek V4 Inference Performance Model

A roofline-based performance model for estimating DeepSeek V4 inference latency on Ascend 910C hardware. Computes per-operation, per-layer, and end-to-end latency for both prefill and decode phases.

## Features

- **Roofline model**: Each operation tracks cube (matmul), vector, and memory time separately; bottleneck = argmax
- **Parallelism**: Models TP (Tensor Parallel), DP (Data Parallel), EP (Expert Parallel), and SP (Sequence Parallel)
- **Communication analysis**: AllReduce, AllToAll, and AllGather cost estimation; comm vs compute breakdown per layer and per phase
- **Per-op breakdown**: ~30 individual operation cost functions covering attention projections, Lightning Index, MoE, mHC, and more
- **Memory analysis**: KV cache sizing and weight memory per rank
- **CSV export**: Timestamped output directory with per-op, per-layer, memory, and summary CSVs
- **No dependencies**: Python standard library only

## Quick Start

```bash
python main.py configs/device_910C.json configs/network_910C.json configs/model_deepseekv4.json configs/runtime_deepseekv4.json
```

Output is saved to `output/<timestamp>/` containing CSV exports and a console log.

Sample output includes:
- Configuration summary (hardware, network, model, runtime)
- Prefill phase: per-op breakdown for representative layers, layer summary with comm%, communication vs computation analysis, total latency
- Decode phase: per-op breakdown, comm vs compute analysis, per-step and total latency, tokens/s
- Memory analysis: KV cache per layer, weight memory per rank, total HBM usage
- End-to-end summary with throughput

## Architecture

The data flow follows a simple pipeline:

1. **config.py** — Load JSON configs into typed dataclasses
2. **roofline.py** — Core roofline engine: given FLOPs/vec_ops/mem_bytes, compute time breakdown
3. **ops.py** — Each op function computes its FLOPs/memory and calls roofline
4. **layers.py** — Aggregates ops into layers, layers into phases (prefill/decode)
5. **memory.py** — Computes KV cache and weight memory requirements
6. **report.py** — Formats and prints all results; exports CSV files; comm vs compute analysis

## Customization

### Adding new hardware configs
Create a new `configs/device_xxx.json` with fields matching `HardwareConfig`:
- `cube_tflops`, `vec_tflops`, `hbm_capacity_gb`, `hbm_bandwidth_gbps`
- `flops_utilization`, `hbm_bw_utilization`

### Adding new model configs
Create a new `configs/model_xxx.json`. Key field: `compress_ratios` must be a list of length `num_layers` specifying the compression ratio per layer (1 = full attention).

## Parameter Search

Find optimal deployment configurations by grid-searching across parallelism strategies, batch sizes, and sequence lengths.

```bash
python param_search/search.py     # Run search (~30s)
python param_search/analyze.py    # Analyze results and generate report
```

The search evaluates 4 independent scenarios:

| Scenario | Optimizes | Metric |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Prefill Latency | Time to first token | `prefill_time_ms` (minimize) |
| Decode Latency | Per-step generation speed | `decode_first_step_ms` (minimize) |
| Prefill Throughput | Prefill tokens per GPU per second | `B*S / prefill_s / GPUs` (maximize) |
| Decode Throughput | Output tokens per GPU per second | `B*output_len / decode_s / GPUs` (maximize) |

**Search grid:** TP ∈ {1,2,4,8,16,32,64}, EP ∈ {1,2,4,...,256}, DP ∈ {1,2,4,8}, BS ∈ {1,...,512}, seq ∈ {1K,...,32K}
**GPU formula:** `physical_gpus = TP * DP`, constraint `(TP*DP) % EP == 0`
**Constraints:** GPU count ∈ [8, 64], HBM ≤ 64 GB

**Key results (Ascend 910C):**

| Scenario | Best Config | Key Metric | GPUs |
|:---|:---|---:|---:|
| Prefill Latency | TP=8, EP=64, DP=8, BS=8 | 179.9 ms | 64 |
| Decode Latency | TP=8, EP=64, DP=8, BS=8 | 14.6 ms/step | 64 |
| Prefill Throughput | TP=8, EP=16, DP=2, BS=512 | 411 tok/s/GPU | 16 |
| Decode Throughput | TP=8, EP=16, DP=2, BS=512 | 207 tok/s/GPU | 16 |

## Key Assumptions

- BF16 (2 bytes) for all weights and activations
- Flash attention memory model (no intermediate materialization to HBM)
- MoE load balance factor = 1.0 for hash-routing layers, configurable for others
- Shared expert can fully overlap with routed expert computation (configurable)
- Communication modeled as additive (not overlapped with compute)
- SP (Sequence Parallel) inserts AllGather at every T_sp -> T_full transition in prefill (before attention, before/after MoE, before LM head)
- Single-batch decode: SP provides no benefit (T=1)
- DP splits global batch evenly; per-rank batch = batch_size / dp
- Decode aggregation uses periodic sampling + trapezoidal interpolation: per-step cost is `constant + linear(S) + periodic(S)` with period `P = LCM(compress_ratios)` = 128 steps; only 2P steps are evaluated instead of all N, giving up to 16× speedup with mathematically exact results
